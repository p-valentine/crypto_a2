For this second assignment, please implement your own
RSA cryptosystem that can generate keys, encrypt text
files and decrypt the encrypted text files. Please submit
the following text of this assignment by email encrypted
using your own RSA system. Attach with your submission the
RSA modulus and the secret decrypting exponent so I can
decrypt your submission. As a bonus component, experiment
with some of the fastest integer factoring algorithms known
in the literature to date (write a short report or play with
some known implementations or implement it yourself).
